Customer Segmentation using K-Means Algorithm
This repository contains code and resources for performing customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a technique used to divide a customer base into groups or segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors. K-Means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm that is widely used for clustering tasks.

# Introduction
Customer segmentation is an important task in marketing and customer analytics. It allows businesses to understand their customers better, identify different customer groups, and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. K-Means clustering is a simple yet powerful algorithm for grouping similar data points together.
This project aims to demonstrate how to use the K-Means algorithm to perform customer segmentation. It provides code and instructions for preparing the data, training the model, and evaluating the results.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/edilauxillea/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/requirements.txt)).
3. Prepare your customer data (see [Data Preparation](https://github.com/edilauxillea/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/README.md#data-preparation)).
4. Train the K-Means model (see [Model Training](https://github.com/edilauxillea/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/README.md#model-training)).
5. Evaluate the segmentation results (see [Evaluation](https://github.com/edilauxillea/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/README.md#evaluation)).

# Usage
The main code file for performing customer segmentation is customer_segmentation.py. You can run this file using the following command:
```
python customer-segmentation.ipynb
```
Before running the code, make sure to modify it to suit your specific data and requirements. The code includes placeholders and comments indicating where you need to provide your own data or make modifications

# Data Preparation
Before training the K-Means model, you need to prepare your customer data. The data should be in a suitable format, and it may require preprocessing or feature engineering depending on your specific use case.

Here are some general steps for data preparation:

1. Load the customer data from a file or database.
2. Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, or handling missing values.
3. Extract relevant features from the data that can be used for clustering.
4. Convert the data into a suitable format for the K-Means algorithm.

# Model Training
To train the K-Means model on your customer data, you can use the KMeans class provided by popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. Here are the general steps for training the model:

1. Load the preprocessed customer data.
2. Initialize an instance of the K-Means model with the desired number of clusters.
3. Fit the model to the customer data using the fit() method.
4. Obtain the cluster assignments for each customer using the predict() method.
5. Make sure to tune the hyperparameters of the K-Means algorithm, such as the number of clusters, to achieve the desired segmentation results.

# Evaluation
Evaluating the quality of customer segmentation is important to assess the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm. There are several metrics you can use to evaluate the results, such as:
- Within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)
- Silhouette coefficient
- Dunn index
- Davies-Bouldin index

Choose one or more evaluation metrics suitable for your specific problem and calculate them using the cluster assignments obtained from the K-Means algorithm.

# Results
After evaluating the segmentation results, you can analyze and interpret the clusters to gain insights into your customer base. Visualizations such as pie charts, scatter plots, bar charts, or heatmaps can help in understanding the characteristics of each cluster. Document the key findings, patterns, or trends observed in each cluster. This information can be used to develop targeted marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, or make informed business decisions.
